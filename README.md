# Dynamic_CapillaryPressure

Code to determine dynamic capillary pressure.
The authors developed a semi-analytical model to predict the dynamic capillary pressure(pc_dyn) - wetting phase saturation (Sw) relation using basic concepts of upscaling, fluid mechanics and geometrical assumptions.  The paper is continuation/ extension to the prior work of Rabbani et al (2019) - "Analytical pore-network approach (apna): A novel method for rapid prediction of capillary pressure-saturation relationship in porous media".

In the 'Validation cases' repository, there are two sample files that we used for validation:
1. Abidoye et al (2014) - viscosity ratio of 500 and applied pressure drop of 10 kPa.
2. Joekar et al (2011) - viscosity ratio of 1 and applied pressure drop of 60 kPa. 

The variables are briefly described and we refer to suitable equations in the manuscript of "Semi-analytical model to predict dynamic capillary pressure - saturation relationship for flows in heterogeneous porous-media" paper.

In the main repository, we place a 'sampleCase.py' file that the users can use to populate the input parameters and compute the dynamic capillary pressure.

In the validation test cases folder there are two examples that the users can use to reproduce the results in the publication.
