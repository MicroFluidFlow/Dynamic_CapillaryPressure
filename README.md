Code to determine dynamic capillary pressure.

In paper "Semi-Analytical Model to Predict Dynamic Capillary Pressure - Water Saturation Relationships for Multiphase Flows in Porous-Media", 
we developed a semi-analytical model to predict the dynamic capillary pressure(pc_dyn) - water saturation (Sw) relation using basic concepts of upscaling, 
fluid mechanics and geometrical assumptions. 

The paper is continuation/ extension to the prior work of Rabbani et al (2019) - "Analytical pore-network approach (apna): A novel method for rapid prediction of 
capillary pressure-saturation relationship in porous media".

In this repository, there are two sample files that we used for validation:
1. Abidoye et al (2014) - viscosity ratio of 500 and applied pressure drop of 10 kPa.
2. Joekar et al (2011) - viscosity ratio of 1 and applied pressure drop of 60 kPa. 

The variables are briefly described and we refer to suitable equations in the manuscript of "Semi-Analytical Model to Predict Dynamic Capillary Pressure
- Water Saturation Relationships for Multiphase Flows in Porous-Media" paper.
